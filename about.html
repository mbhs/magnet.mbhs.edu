        <h1>About the Magnet</h1>
        <p>In 1985, Montgomery County Public Schools opened its Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet
            Program
            within Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Magnet Program is designed to offer
            accelerated, interdisciplinary courses in science, mathematics, and computer science for highly able
            students
            particularly interested in these subjects.</p>
        <!--<p>Ninth and tenth grade Magnet students take four courses each semester within the Magnet curriculum (science,
					mathematics, research, and computer science), and four courses each semester in other disciplines with the rest
					of the Blair student body. This allows Magnet students to take full advantage of Blair's wide variety of traditional
					high school offerings. Juniors and seniors have fewer required Magnet courses, and therefore complete their schedules with electives.</p>-->
        <p> Since Magnet students have a number of extra academic requirements, magnet students have an eight-period
            day, instead
            of the normal seven-period day of most county high school students. Magnet students can (and do!) take full
            advantage
            of Blair's other extracurriculars such as athletics, student clubs, the school's bands and plays, and other
            activities.</p>
        <!--<p>Magnet students have been semifinalists and finalists in the <strong> Intel (formerly Westinghouse) Science Talent Search </strong>,
					<strong> National Merit Semifinalists </strong> (more Semifinalists than any other school in the state for over a decade),
					Montgomery County Science Fair Grand Award Winners, first place winners in the <strong> International Science and Engineering Fair</strong>,
					<strong>Montgomery County Mathematics League champions</strong> over twenty straight years, Super-Quest finalist teams, national winners
					in the NASA Space Science Student Involvement Project,	American Computer Science League National Champions, first place winners in the
					<strong> National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium </strong> (2008), and gold medal winners of the <strong> International Mathematics, 
					Computer Science, Physics and Biology Olympiad</strong> (2006-2009), and much more.</p>-->
