  <h2>What are you applying to?</h2>
			<p>The Blair Magnet Program is funded to accept 100 Montgomery County students for its incoming 9th Grade class. Because the Magnet Program's curriculum is interrelated between grades and sequentially different from other high schools, only students entering 9th Grade are accepted. No mid-high school transfer of students is permitted. However, juniors and seniors enrolled in other Montgomery County high schools who meet the prerequisites and can provide their own transportation are eligible for magnet electives that are not offered at their home school.</p>
			<h2>Who should apply?</h2>
			<p>Students in Grade 8 with a strong interest in science, mathematics, and computer science who are enrolled in at least Algebra I may apply to the Blair Magnet Program for entrance the following school year. Applicants must reside in one of the following MCPS high school clusters at the time of testing (for more information on testing, see below): Bethesda-Chevy Chase, Winston Churchill, the Downcounty Consortium (Montgomery Blair, Albert Einstein, John F. Kennedy, Northwood, Wheaton), the Northeast Consortium (Blake, Paint Branch, Springbrook), Walter Johnson, Richard Montgomery, Rockville, Sherwood, Walt Whitman, or Thomas S. Wootton. Students in other high school clusters can apply to the Poolesville Magnet Program.</p>
			<h2>Where and when can you get additional information?</h2>
			<p>Each fall there are informational meetings about the Magnet for interested
			  students and their parents/guardians. In 2018, families are invited
			  to learn about the Magnet on Monday, <span style="font-weight: bold">October
			  8th</span>, at 7:00 PM
			  at Blair High School.</p>
	  <h2>How do you apply?</h2>
		  <p>Please carefully read the <strong><a href="/departments/magnet/pdfs/High School Magnet Application Programs Directions.pdf">instructions for applying to the Magnet here</a></strong>. Once you have read through the instructions and gathered all relevant information, current MCPS students can complete the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/0XjQaKSxI5BtYWBm2" target="_blank">online application here</a> using their MCPS Google/Choromebook accounts.
