					<p>The starting grounds for most of the students in the Magnet Program, Precalculus will provide students the basics for future Magnet math courses, such as Analysis 1 and Analysis 2. In Precalculus A, students will begin to learn functions and their properties, as well as introductory trigonometry. As a continuation of the math curriculum, the Precalculus B and C courses will expand students' horizons in solving various equations, and learning about vectors, polar coordinates, conics, and series and sequences. Although the information presented in Precalculus is a lot of ground to cover in two or three semesters, students will be well-prepared for math in their future years.</p>

					<p>Boiled down to one sentence, calculus is simply the study of change. But what makes calculus so powerful is the elegant concept of limits that drives it at its core.  By taking everything you've learned in math so far and mixing it up with the magic of limits, a new world of theoretical and applicable results opens up.  Soon after covering the basics of derivatives and integrals, you'll be able to chug away with "The Limit Machine" on some of the fundamental concepts from physics to economics.  Plus, in the Magnet we call this course Analysis because it covers a lot more information than a normal high-school calculus course.</p>

					<p>So you've taken Analysis 1, and you've mastered change in one variable.  But how do you deal with problems in the real world that deal with change in all three dimensions?  That's where Analysis 2 comes in.  In this course you'll learn how to extend some of the concepts from Analysis 1 to into multiple dimensions, leading to deep connections in fields as varied as electromagnetism to weather patterns.  In the second semester of the course you'll cover methods of solving differential equations used to describe various forms of motion.</p>

					<p>Mark Twain once wrote that "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."   Twain was right that numbers are manipulated all the time to support every claim, but the harshness of his cynicism may have resulted from his incomplete understanding of true, mathematical statistics.  Far from the stereotype of con men rattling off questionable numbers, statistics is in fact a mathematically rigorous and intellectually rich field of research.  In addition to learning how to spot flaws in real-life statistical attempts, in this course you'll cover the potential sources of bias in a study, the proper procedures for setting up statistically-sound experiments, and the correct methods for analyzing various types of data.  Besides providing a mathematical understanding of statistics, this course is also useful when designing and analyzing experiments during the Senior Research Project experience.</p>

					<p>Most of your mathematics education in school has probably been focused on continuous mathematics, with geometrical shapes that form perfectly connected curves and functions that can be applied all across the real numbers.  But what about phenomena that are fundamentally discrete, that involve counting distinct objects with separate numbers rather than on a continuum?  Discrete mathematics tries to fit this entire half of mathematics into a single course, focusing on concepts from areas such as combinatorics, graph theory, and logic, paying special attention to applications in computer science.</p>
					<div class="toggle" onclick="toggle('discrete');">Show/Hide formal description</div>

					<p>Linear Algebra is a field that deals with vectors, matrices, and spaces.  You may think that these concepts sounds way too abstract, but in fact linear algebra may be one of the most applicable and foundational fields in mathematics.  Besides being used to formalize a variety of fundamental ideas in mathematics, linear algebra is connected to a variety of computer applications, from computer graphics to network algorithms.  In fact, the basic ideas used in modern search engines like Google are rooted in linear algebra.</p>

					<p>You may know that complex numbers arise when you play around too much with square roots and negative numbers.  However, complex numbers aren't just curiosities resulting from bad mathematical behavior.  The most advanced calculus class offered in the Magnet, Complex Analysis takes the concepts from the first two Analysis courses a step further by pushing them into the exotic realm of the complex plane.  In this course you'll study some of the concepts that are being applied to the hottest problems in mathematics and physics today, such as the Riemann Hypothesis and string theory.</p>

					<p>Randomness, standard deviations, means...regression... all these statistics concepts have the perfect application in, of all places, sports.  In Sports Statistics, students use the statistical tests and topics they learned in Applied Statistics to explain various phenomena in the world of sports.  Daily viewings of SportsCenter add color to this relatively chill class.  Though some knowledge of sports is recommended to fully appreciate this course, Sports Statistics is a great to delve deeper into the world of statistics.</p>

					  Biology is one of those classes where you can relax, yet learn a great

					<p>There are so many complicated ways of regulating genes and their expression that it's a miracle that you don't have some crazy deformity (unless you do, in which case, sorry).  You could have eight sets of chromosomes (great - if you were a strawberry), or have urine that smells like maple syrup.  Remember Mendel's ratios from sophomore bio?  They hardly ever work, because of this strange thing called reality - things like lethal alleles and penetrance and duplicate genes.  Oh, and by the way, genetics is one of the most useful classes to take in your junior year if you're interested in an SRP related in any way to genomics, or proteomics, or if you're planning on doing any genetic manipulation of any kind.  There is, in fact, a reason why this class is double period.</p>

					<p>Classical physics (think ninth grade) works well most of the time, but everyone knows that when it comes to talking about the Universe, you have to turn to Einstein and his theory of relativity.

					<p>Thermodynamics has the unfortunate reputation of being the class where people blow things up. For the most part, this reputation is true. Thermo is a very "hands-on" course.

Optics, the study of the behavior and properties of light, is one class that you can't miss.  In Optics, you learn both classical and modern theories/approaches.  Optics is a one-semester course, so naturally you learn a lot in very little time; this means there is a fair amount of work to complete (but they're fun).  Some memorable projects include applying what you learned in class to designing and engineering a kaleidoscope and optical camera. Optical science is relevant to many disciplines including electrical engineering and medicine. In the end, optics is a class that will last you a lifetime.</p>

					<p>Despite the hundreds of able, gifted students that have walked the halls of Montgomery Blair High School, no one has yet succeeded in measuring the exact height of the school's huge and mysterious steeple. Magnet students try every year, constructing rudimentary measuring devices and implementing trigonometry to wager a guess, but an estimate of a mere five feet is not unusual in spite of their best attempts. The mantra of "try, try again" is one that Magnet students learn to embrace early on in high school, as they enter the dusty Research and Experimentation classroom. From building trebuchets to conducting Chemistry experiments, students utilize and hone their problem skills while exposing themselves to the real-life applications of the concepts learned in other interdisciplinary Magnet classes. So don't be alarmed if you happen to hear the high-pitched squeal of a band saw while walking down the 210s hallway - it's just the sound of learning, Magnet-style.</p>

Over the summer you'll conduct your project and when you return first semester senior year, you'll enter SRP B. SRP B is for the actual paper-writing process. You'll get drafts edited, learn how to make a poster and presentation of your work, and have the opportunity to enter your project in various competitions.
